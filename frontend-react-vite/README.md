npm create vite@latest <app-name>
npm i
npm run dev

we have hmr - hot module replacement in vite
to see it in action dont autosave frequently, instead save only without errors and notice the count doesnt change

we can also use env variables without dotenv npm modules, look in app.jsx

we can also add scss and plugins
